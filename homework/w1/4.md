# Homework 4 8/8

## Sending lamports

1. **Using the command line tool, send your colleagues some lamports**

Using the Solana CLI, send lamports to your colleagues. Check your balance and your colleagues' balances before and after the transaction.

2. **Break Solana Game**

In your teams, try the [Break Solana](https://break.solana.com/wallet?cluster=devnet) game on one of the Test networks. Post a screenshot of your team's highest score on Discord.

3. **Fizz buzz program**

Create a project called bootcamp using Cargo:

- The main function should print a welcome message.
- Write a 'fizz buzz' function that will be called from your main function:
  - The function should have a loop counting up to 301
  - If the count is divisible by 3, print "fizz"
  - If the count is divisible by 5 print "buzz"
  - If the count is divisible by 3 and 5 print "fizz buzz"
  - At the end print the number of times "fizz buzz" occurred.

4. **Extra Credit: Two Sum**

If the Fizz Buzz program was no sweat, here's an additional challenge for you to have fun with.

We have a Vector of integers called `nums` and a `target` integer. Return the two indices that add up to the `target` value.

Rules:
- There's always one unique solution for each list.
- You can't use the same number twice.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

Here's a starter code for the Two Sum problem:

```rust
fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
    // your code goes here
}

fn main() {  
    println!("{:?}", two_sum(vec![2, 3, 4, 5,], 9));  
}
```

There's a brute force solution that's a bit easier to figure out, but see if you can also use a HashMap for a more efficient solution.

Try it on [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=9709f5c874cdf5ee3bbcb3b5d38960cb)

5. **Practical Task: Implement the Fizz Buzz program**
   - Step 1: Create a new Rust project named "bootcamp" using Cargo
   - Step 2: Implement the main function with a welcome message
   - Step 3: Implement the fizz_buzz function as described
   - Step 4: Call the fizz_buzz function from main
   - Step 5: Run the program and verify the output

- **Coding Challenge: Two Sum**

  Implement the Two Sum function as described above. Try both the brute force approach and the more efficient HashMap approach.

  ```rust
  fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
      // Your implementation here
  }
  ```
