7. **Install Rust if needed.**
   - Follow [these instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Mac / Linux
   - See [these instructions](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html) for Windows
   - Alternatively use [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolanaBootcamp) for a linux environment

[Confirm that you've installed Rust or used gitpod]

**Extra Credit:**

- **Recommended Reading:**
  - Read [Send and Receive Tokens with the Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/examples/transfer-tokens)
  - Study [String Data Type Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html)

- **Coding Challenge: Reverse an Array**

  Here's a simple puzzle to get you more familiar with Rust and its methods:

  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let mut array = [1, 2, 3, 4,];
      
      // add your code here 
      println!("{:?}", array);
  }
  ```

  Feel free to set it up in your own environment and try it locally if you have it already set up. Otherwise, try it on [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=02b1fd45e606bf3d4963df84ca766aae).
