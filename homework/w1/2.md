# Homework 2

## SOLANA ECOSYSTEM

1. **How many validators are there currently?**

As of today, there are approximately 3400 validators on the Solana network.

2. **What is special about this [block](https://explorer.solana.com/block/0)?**

Block 0 is the genesis block of Solana. It's the very first block in the Solana blockchain, created when the network was launched.

3. **What is special about this [address](https://explorer.solana.com/address/1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111)?**

This address is known as the "incinerator" address in Solana. It's a special address used to permanently remove SOL from circulation. Any tokens sent to this address are effectively "burned" and cannot be recovered.

4. **What is this [transaction](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/45pGoC4Rr3fJ1TKrsiRkhHRbdUeX7633XAGVec6XzVdpRbzQgHhe6ZC6Uq164MPWtiqMg7wCkC6Wy3jy2BqsDEKf) doing?**

This transaction is performing a significant token burn operation on the Solana network.

5. **What is the largest balance you can find in an account?**

Around 

6. **What advantages will the end user see when using Solana compared to other blockchains?**

Speed: Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, resulting in near-instant transactions.
Low fees: Transaction costs on Solana are typically a fraction of a cent.
Scalability: The network can handle a high volume of transactions without congestion.
User-friendly wallets: Many Solana wallets offer smooth, intuitive interfaces.


7. **Install Rust if needed.**
   - Follow [these instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Mac / Linux
   - See [these instructions](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html) for Windows
   - Alternatively use [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolanaBootcamp) for a linux environment

- **Coding Challenge: Reverse an Array**

  Here's a simple puzzle to get you more familiar with Rust and its methods:

  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let mut array = [1, 2, 3, 4,];
      // MY PART
      // add your code here 
      let arrayLength = array.len();
      let mut count = 0u32;

      while count < array_length / 2 {
          let temp = array[count];
        array[count] = array[array_length - 1 - count];
        array[array_length - 1 - count] = temp;
        count += 1;

      }
      println!("{:?}", array);
  }
  ```

  ```cli
  ./exercise1
  [4, 3, 2, 1]
  ```

  Feel free to set it up in your own environment and try it locally if you have it already set up. Otherwise, try it on [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=02b1fd45e606bf3d4963df84ca766aae).
