# Homework 5

## Rust Exercises

1. **Install the exercises and fix the path**

   ```bash
   cargo install --force --path .
   ```

2. **Run interactive homework window**

   ```bash
   rustlings homework 5
   ```

3. **Current exercise example**

   The current exercise is stated in the hint command, for example:

   ```bash
   option2
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
    2 |  // Make me compile! Execute `rustlings hint option2` for hints
    3 |  
    4 |  // I AM NOT DONE
    5 |  
   ```

4. **Modifying and progressing through exercises**

   - The shell will display which exercises have either failed at compilation or testing.
   - Modify the file and if it passes all the tests, remove this line:
     ```
     // I AM NOT DONE
     ```
   - That will take you to the next file to fix.

5. **Exercise source and environment**

   - The exercises are based on the rustlings exercises, adapted to follow the lessons.
   - You can use this [gitpod environment](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolanaBootcamp)

6. **Exercise repository**

   Exercises can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolanaBootcamp) 
   The rust exercises are in a folder `homework_rust`

7. **Practical Task: Completing the exercises**
   - Install the exercises
   - Run the interactive homework window
   - Work through each exercise, modifying the code and removing the "I AM NOT DONE" comment when complete
   - Progress through all exercises until completion
