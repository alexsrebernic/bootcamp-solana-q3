- **Coding Challenge: Running Sum of 1D Vector**

  Given a vector `nums`, create a new vector called `runningSum` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the beginning of the vector up to index `i`. Return the running sum of `nums`.

  **Example 1:**
  ```
  Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
  Output: [1,3,6,10]
  Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4]
  ```

  **Example 2:**
  ```
  Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
  Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
  Explanation: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1]
  ```

  **Example 3:**
  ```
  Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
  Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
  ```

  ```rust
  fn running_sum(nums: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {  
      // Your code here
  }  
    
  fn main() {  
      println!("{:?}", running_sum(vec![1, 1, 1, 1, 1]));
  }
  ```

  See if you can figure out a "Rusty" way to do it using Rust's iterators and methods.
