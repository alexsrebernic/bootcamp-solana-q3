# Homework 5/7 

1. **Fill in the Sli.do Poll about your goals for this course**

My goals for this course are:
To secure the contractor position I've been offered
To learn more about Real World Assets (RWA) if resources are available
To advance my professional career in web3


2. **Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like Monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.**
   - Consider what are the essential pieces of functionality? How could people cheat? How could you prevent them from cheating?
   - This is just a general discussion; there is no need to write any code or do any design.

Not discussed

3. **Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?**

No, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) aren't really a move towards decentralization. They're actually the opposite - they're digital versions of regular money controlled by central banks.
But here's the thing: CBDCs might actually help cryptocurrency adoption in a roundabout way. By getting people used to digital money, CBDCs could make it easier for folks to understand and use cryptocurrencies. It's like CBDCs are giving everyone a crash course in digital cash.
At the same time, CBDCs might make truly decentralized cryptocurrencies stand out more. People might start asking, "What makes Bitcoin different from this government digital coin?" This could lead to more interest in decentralized systems.
So while CBDCs themselves aren't decentralized, they might end up giving decentralized cryptocurrencies a boost by making digital money mainstream and highlighting what makes crypto unique.

4. **Listen to the Zero Knowledge [episode](https://zeroknowledge.fm/135-2/) about Solana**
